# Portfolio Website 2025

This is the repository for my new portfolio site! I felt that my old one needed an upgrade to better showcase my personal taste in web design as well as my technical skills better so I took some time to create an entirely new website from scratch. I am always open to feedback and suggestions on improving this so please feel free to suggest any improvements!

## Future Considerations:
* The current tech stack for this project is a simple HTML/CSS/JS setup. There's no immediate ideas to add a backend to this project but in the future I'm considering translating this project to a framework like React or Next.JS.
* The website will be deployed through GitHub pages for the time being, but I am looking to host my website on my own domain in the future. 

## Features to Add:
* Light Mode/Dark Mode settings
* Cursor Animations
* More Interactivity!
